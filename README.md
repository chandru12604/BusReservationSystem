ðŸšŒ Java Bus Reservation System
This is a simple Java console-based application that simulates a basic bus ticket reservation system. It allows users to view available buses, book tickets by entering passenger details and travel dates, and view all bookings made.

The project demonstrates key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java, such as encapsulation, class design, and collection handling using ArrayList.

âœ… Key Features:
View available buses with details (AC/Non-AC, capacity)

Book tickets with passenger name, bus number, and date

Check for seat availability before confirming booking

View all confirmed bookings

Menu-driven command-line interface

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals:
Understand OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods)

Use Java ArrayList, Scanner, and Date classes

Implement a real-world console-based Java project
